<h1>The Original Game Part 1</h1>
<p>So in my initial Intro post, I mentioned wanting to take a deep dive into Original Dungeons and Dragons, and so lets jump in.</p>
<p>Over on the Audio Dungeon discord they've been running a Hobbit Slow Read, following on from doing the same with the Lord of the Rings - I've fallen off the wagon reading and probably won't join back in but the Lord of the Rings slow read was very fun and a very different experience from simply reading the work. If this sounds interesting, then you should listen to Mirke's excellent podcast episodes where he and his daughter share their thoughts on the current chapter: <a href='https://creators.spotify.com/pod/show/mirke-the-meek'>here</a></p>
<p>I'd been toying with doing a similar thing with RPG products (gamesystems and modules) but then I stumbled across this <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/odnd/comments/1g98rdb/complete_reading_order_question/'>reddit post</a> titled 'Complete Reading Order Question' and so thats what I'm going to do - I'm going to read each entry of this list, slowly section by section, sharing any insights that I gain from the activity.</p>
<h2>The Reading Order</h2>
<p>This is the order I intend to read in then, ordered with an approximation of publish date:</p>
<ol>
<li>Chainmail (1971)</li>
<li>Outdoor Survival (1972)</li>
<li>Men & Magic (1974)</li>
<li>Monsters & Treasure (1974)</li>
<li>The Underworld & Wilderness Adventure (1974)</li>
<li>The Strategic Review Vol. 1, No. 1 (1975)</li>
<li>The Strategic Review Vol. 1, No. 2 (1975)</li>
<li>Greyhawk (1975)</li>
<li>The Strategic Review Vol. 1, No. 3 (1975)</li>
<li> The Strategic Review Vol. 1, No. 4 (1975)</li>
<li> The Strategic Review Vol. 1, No. 5 (1975)</li>
<li> Blackmoor (1975)</li>
<li> The Strategic Review Vol. 2, No. 1 (1976)</li>
<li> The Strategic Review Vol. 2, No. 2 (1976)</li>
<li> Eldritch Wizardry (1976)</li>
<li> The Dragon Vol. 1, No. 1 (1976)</li>
<li> Gods, Demi-Gods and Heroes (1976)</li>
<li> The Dragon Vol. 1, No. 2 (1976)</li>
<li> The Dragon Vol. 1, No. 3 (1976)</li>
<li> The Dragon Vol. 1, No. 4 (1976)</li>
<li> Swords & Spells (1976)</li>
<li> Dungeonmaster's Index (1977) <em>I don't know if this is worth looking into, if I can even find it</em></li>
<li> The Dragon Vol. 1, No. 5 (1977)</li>
<li> The Dragon Vol. 1, No. 6 (1977)</li>
<li> The Dragon Vol. 1, No. 7 (1977)</li>
<li> The Dragon Vol. 1, No. 8 (1977)</li>
<li> The Dragon Vol. 2, No. 1 (1977)</li>
<li> The Dragon Vol. 2, No. 2 (1977)</li>
<li> The Dragon Vol. 2, No. 3 (1977)</li>
<li> The Dragon Vol. 2, No. 4 (1977)</li>
</ol>
<p>I need to add Alarums and Excursions, Judges Guild Journal and other products, Holmes Basic (and the draft), The first fantasy campaign, Arduin, Empire of the Petal Throne, Dalluhn manuscript, Wargamer's Digest Vol. 1, No. 7, Europa 6-8, The Great Plains Game Players Newsletter No. 9, White Dwarf, Adventures in Fantasy</p>
<p>I can also look at later products which look back: Blackmoor Foundations, https://playingattheworld.blogspot.com/2012/08/gygaxs-thief-addition-1974.html?m=1%C2%A0, <a href='https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/464791/dragons-beyond'>RHamilton</a></p>
<p>As you can see, this might take me a year or more. Probably more, and I'm probably missing things. If you have any suggested reading from this time period referencing OD&D please reach out and I'll add it to my list.</p>
<p>Theres other places to look for reference as well, a look at Appendix N is certainly on the cards, as well as looking forward to Basic/Expert and BECMI and Advanced Dungeons and Dragons for clarifications or to retro clones for the same.</p>
